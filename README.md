Minesweeper is a logic game where mines are hidden in a grid of squares. The object of this game is to open all safe squares in the quickest time possible. The user is able to play the game like normal by left clicking on squares to reveal the number of mines around it or by right clicking on a square to flag the location of a suspected mine. The user is able to choose between three levels of difficulty, beginner is a 4x4 grid with 4 mines, intermediate is a 8x8 grid with 15 mines, and expert is a 12x12 grid with 40 mines, or they are able to create their own custom level. The user is also able to switch the theme of the game from the classic minesweeper theme to Halloween theme, which changes the images of the mines.
